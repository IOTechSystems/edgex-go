# The low-footprint project

This repository is a fork of the [EdgeX Foundry project](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go) that aims to reduce the memory and disk footprint of the EdgeX Foundry services.

Under this repository, there is a [`low-footprint`](.) directory that contains the following subdirectories:
- [`core-combo-sample`](./core-combo-sample): A sample implementation of the low-footprint core-combo service.
- [`deployment`](./deployment): Scripts used for deploying the low-footprint EdgeX services on STM32MP157.
- [`performance`](./performance): Scripts used for performance testing of the low-footprint EdgeX services.

For more details about the low-footprint EdgeX services, please refer to the README files in the subdirectories.
